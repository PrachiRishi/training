      <p>Climate change and heavy Earth pollution result in insane Global warming, it oftenly occurs when carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases both rise all the way up tok Earth's atmosphere, they may stay for several months, even sometimes, YEARS! How does earth get hotter and the tan get darker by any of this, you may be wondering? Well, when all these various gases are surrounded in the atmosphere, they tend to absorb the sunlight, and trap the heat while at it!!

      <p> I, myself, have come up with a few basic resolutions that are overheard and well known but highkey help in the longrun, for starters, spread the word to your family, or friends, maybe even online, to deliver the message to the internet users. Other than speaking up, you can always power your loving home with renewable energy. you might not be as aware of renewable enegey as you are of electrical energy, well, renewable energy bases its energy and generates on power that comes from the wind or solar and can subscribe to an organization that vets renewable energy options.              </p>
